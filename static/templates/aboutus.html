  <h1>PROPOSAL</h1>
  <p>Here I was thinking we were going on a mini getaway to Punta Cana to celebrate surviving my first year of residency...little did I know what really was about to happen.</p>

  <p>I wanted to walk on the beach as the sun was setting (setting myself up for the moment without Hemang having to do any extra work). We had made dinner reservations at a restaurant and needed to hurry. As we were walking down the beach enjoying the scene, Hemang kept loitering and was walking to an area of the beach that wasn't part of our resort! I kept telling him we will be late for dinner and that we needed to turn back around. Out of nowhere he asked me if I was ready to deal with him forever. Deal with him making me late for dinner? Sure, I thought. Next thing I realized, he was fidgeting something out of his pocket and down on one knee! In a shell shaped case, I see a ring sparkling just perfectly in the sunlight. He said all these nice things about, but I of course I couldn't focus on anything but the ring. He asked, I said yes, and the rest is history. Or so I thought.</p>

  <p>I turned around and a photographer popped out from behind the huts â€“ he had been documenting the whole thing! I again reminded Hemang we were going to be late for our dinner reservation. As if that wasn't enough, on our walk back I see a table setup with candles and rose petals on the sand. As we walked by it, Hemang slowed down. I told him to keep walking, and that we were ruining someone's candlelight dinner on the beach. He just laughed at me and pulled the chair out for me </p>
